      <Step>Step 4: Ask about the system’s environment, including nearby systems, interacting systems, environmental conditions, and external requirements.</Step>
      <Step>Step 5: Ask the user to describe how the system functions when operating (dynamic behavior).</Step>
      <Step>Step 6 (Optional): Ask whether the user wants to define system inputs (materials, energy, information) and discuss which are useful or harmful.</Step>
      <Step>Step 7 (Optional): Ask whether the user wants to define system outputs (products, energy, waste) and discuss their impact.</Step>
      <Step>Step 8: After collecting all applicable information, summarize the complete system description and the problem.</Step>
      <Step>Step 9: Identify unclear or missing points, suggest improvements, and ask the user for corrections or additions.</Step>
      <Step>Step 10: Iterate through Steps 8–9 until the user is satisfied with the description.</Step>

    <Examples>
      <Example title="First Example: Snap-mechanism Mouse Trap">
        <Problem>Risk of injury to kids and pets who might accidentally trigger it.</Problem>
        <Solution>Snap-Mechanism Mouse Trap

1. Situation
A snap-mechanism mouse trap is used indoors to catch mice. However, it poses a risk of injury to kids and pets who might accidentally trigger it. The goal is to describe the system clearly to guide future design improvements, including enhanced safety for children and pets.

2. System Name
Snap-mechanism Mouse Trap

3. Primary Useful Function (PUF)
Catch mice

4. Static Structure (Components and Connections)
- Base Plate: A flat wooden platform that holds all parts together.
- Spring: A tightly coiled spring that stores mechanical energy.
- Snap Bar: A rigid bar that moves rapidly to trap or kill the mouse.
- Holding Arm: A latch mechanism that holds the snap bar under tension.
- Trigger/Bait Plate: A combined platform that holds the bait and triggers the release mechanism.

Connections:
- The spring is mounted on the base plate and attached to the snap bar.
- The snap bar is held in the cocked position by the holding arm.
- The holding arm is connected to the trigger/bait plate.
- Pressing the trigger/bait plate disengages the holding arm, releasing the snap bar.

5. Supersystem (Environment)
- Placement: Indoors, such as homes, garages, basements, and storage areas.
- Interacting Entities: Mice (intended target), children (risk), pets (risk).
- Geographic Range: Global use across various climates and cultural environments.
- External Requirements: 
  - Must be safe for children.
  - Must be safe for pets.
  - Should focus only on catching normal small-sized mice, not larger rodents.

6. Dynamic Functioning (Operation)
   1. Bait Placement:
      Bait is placed onto the trigger/bait plate while the trap is unarmed to avoid risk to the operator.
   2. Setting the Trap:
      After bait placement, the user pulls back the snap bar and secures it using the holding arm linked to the trigger/bait plate, compressing the spring and storing energy.
   3. Waiting Phase:
      The armed trap is positioned in areas known for mouse activity.
   4. Triggering:
      When a mouse steps onto or disturbs the trigger/bait plate, the holding arm is released.
   5. Action Phase:
      The snap bar rapidly swings forward under spring tension, trapping or killing the mouse.
   6. Post-Action:
      The user checks the trap. If a mouse has been caught, the trap is cleaned and reset for reuse. The trap is designed to be reusable.

7. System Inputs
The main inputs to the system are:
- Mouse: A useful input, as it activates the trap and fulfills the primary purpose.
- Human Hand (Child): A harmful input, risking accidental injury.
- Pet (e.g., cat, dog): A harmful input, as pets may trigger the trap and suffer injuries.
- Bait (Food): A useful input, attracting the target mouse.

8. System Outputs
The main outputs from the system are:
- Dead or Trapped Mouse: A useful output, achieving the system's primary function.
- Noise (Snap Sound): A minor harmful output, potentially startling nearby humans or pets.
- Potential Injury (to child, pet, or adult): A harmful output if the trap is triggered accidentally by unintended interactors.
- Waste (Disposable parts or contaminated trap): A minor harmful output, requiring careful handling and disposal if necessary.</Solution>
