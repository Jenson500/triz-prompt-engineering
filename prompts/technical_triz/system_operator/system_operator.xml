  <Instructions>
  
    <Goal>
      Analyze a technical system from multiple perspectives using the TRIZ 9 Boxes (9 Screens) model. This structured approach identifies issues, constraints, and opportunities for improvement.
    </Goal>
	
    <Instruction type="general">
      <Step>Distinguish between <b>Evolution-Oriented</b> and <b>Problem-Oriented</b> 9 Boxes. Use Evolution-Oriented as default. If the user mentions a problem or it becomes clear from context, switch to Problem-Oriented. Ask for clarification if unclear.</Step>
    </Instruction>
	
    <Instructions type="evolution-oriented">
      <Step>Describe the current state of the technical system. Ask the user to describe the current state of the technical system to be analyzed.</Step>
      <Step>Generate the 9 Boxes matrix (3x3). Use a 3x3 matrix with rows: Supersystem, System, Subsystem, and columns: Past, Present, Future.
	        Past: Analyze predecessors and components of past systems.
			Present: Evaluate current components and interactions.
			Future: Project developments and innovations.
	  </Step>
      <Output>Create a table with rows: Supersystem, System, Subsystem; columns: Past, Present, Future. Include time points like,e.g. "1950", 	"2100", "in 20 years"). Ask users if they want to specify time points. Fill-in the details for each cell.</Output>
    </Instructions>
	
    <Instructions type="problem-oriented">
      <Step>Define the problem and overall goal.</Step>
      <Step>Use the problem-timeline: Past = before the problem, Present = during, Future = after.</Step>
	  <Step>Record the specific problem and system where it occurs. Fill in "System Present" with a guiding question and find solutions.</Step>
	  <Step>Break down subsystems. Fill in "Subsystem Present" with guiding questions and solutions.</Step>
	  <Step>Analyze the environment and fill in "Supersystem Present."</Step>
	  <Step>Identify time "Before the problem" as Past. Analyze System, Subsystem, Supersystem and find solutions.</Step>
	  <Step>Define the time "After the problem" as Future. Define the overall goal and analyze each system level for solutions to still reach the overall goal.</Step>
      <Output>Create two tables: one with questions, one with proposed solutions. Table 1: Relevant questions for each cell - Table 2: Proposed solutions for each cell Always align with the system level (Supersystem, System, Subsystem) and time point (Past, Present, Future). State the overall goal.</Output>

        <Title>Understanding the 9 Boxes</Title>
        <Explanation>
		The TRIZ 9 Boxes predict future developments based on past and present analysis.
		Rows: Supersystem, System, Subsystem
		Columns: Past, Present, Future
		Past
		  Supersystem: Predecessor components interacting with the Past-System
		  System: The predecessor system (Past-System)
		  Subsystem: Components of the Past-System
		Present
		  Supersystem: Components interacting with the current system
		  System: The system being analyzed
		  Subsystem: Components of the current system
		Future
		  Supersystem: Projected supersystem developments
		  System: Projected future system
		  Subsystem: Projected component developments

    <Examples>
      <Example title="Car">
        <Past time="before 1900">Supersystem: early roads, traffic signs, coachman; System: horse-drawn carriage; Subsystem: horse, carriage, wheels</Past>
        <Present time="1900-today">Supersystem: streets, traffic lights, driver; System: car; Subsystem: engine, chassis, wheels</Present>
        <Future time="in 5 years">Supersystem: intelligent roads; System: autonomous car; Subsystem: hydrogen engine, AI systems</Future>
		<Summary>Self-driving hydrogen cars on intelligent streets, driverless operation.</Summary>
      </Example>

      <Example title="Smartphone">
        <Past time="before 1994">Supersystem: telephone lines, desk, telephone exchange; System: landline phone; Subsystem: receiver, base unit, dial</Past>
        <Present time="today">Supersystem: 5G, wifi, cloud, pockets; System: smartphone; Subsystem: screen, sensors, battery, casing</Present>
        <Future time="in 10 years">Supersystem: worldwide wifi, clothing-integrated reception, 6G; System: wearable smartphone; Subsystem: microscopic electronics, mini casings, ultra-fast battery</Future>
		<Summary>Future smartphones will be even more integrated, faster, and miniaturized.</Summary>

    <ProblemExample title="Leaking Pens in Shirt Pockets">
      <Problem>Ink stains shirts</Problem>
      <OverallGoal>Ensure neat appearance</OverallGoal>
      <System>Pen</System>
      <Subsystems>Pen case, refill (ink), retraction mechanism, clip</Subsystems>
      <Supersystem>User, paper, shirt, desk, PC, smartphone</Supersystem>
      <Analysis>
        <Past>Supersystem: Paper uses pigment capsules (no ink in pen); System: Pen requires constant actuation to write; Subsystem: Retraction mechanism in grip section</Past>
        <Present>Supersystem: Shirt neutralizes ink; System: Pen retracts refill when vertical; Subsystem: Clip locks only when refill is retracted</Present>
        <Future>Supersystem: Shirt pocket is ink-resistant; System: Pen includes cleaning agent compartment; Subsystem: The ink is water-soluble to allow for easy washing</Future>
