1. Change the color of an object or its surroundings: Using red light in a photographic darkroom for lighting to avoid damaging the films.
2. Changing the transparency of an object or its surroundings: Refillable lighters often have a transparent gas tank so that the user can see the gas level at a glance.
3. Using color additives to observe objects or processes that are difficult to see: (1) The blue color of the outer bristles of a toothbrush's head fades with use, indicating when the brush needs to be replaced. (2) A flower pot moisture indicator changes color to inform the user that the plant needs water. (3) pH test strips change color when they come into contact with liquids, depending on the pH value. The pH value can be read on a color scale.
4. If color additives are already used, use phosphors, luminescent substances or other marked substances: Fault diagnosis with UV light and fluorescent dyes is used, for example, in materials science, where hairline cracks in metal products (e.g. crankshafts for engines) can be made visible.
5. Change in the emission properties of an object exposed to radiant heat: (1) Sterilization indicators visually indicate the correct completion of the sterilization process through color or pattern changes. To ensure that all instruments are actually sterile, such indicators are routinely used in clinics and research facilities. (2) Temperature-sensitive (thermochromic) dyes used on food labels to indicate when the desired serving temperature has been reached.

# IP #33 Homogeneity

*Synonyms:* similarity of the materials used, similar and uniform composition, identical or very similar materials in the system

1. Make objects that interact with each other out of the same or similar material: (1) When using biodegradable garbage bags, organic waste can be collected in the bags and does not need to be removed from the bag for composting. (2) Several parts of wooden furniture are connected by wooden dowels made of the same or similar material (wood) to avoid mutual damage or wear of the parts due to different hardness. (3) For metals, rivets are made of the same material as the parts to be joined to avoid corrosion and wear of the parts due to different hardness. (4) Make ice cubes from the same drink as the drink to be chilled to avoid diluting (watering down) the drink.

# IP #34 Discarding and Recovering

*Synonyms:* Regeneration, rejection and regeneration, discarding or converting unnecessary parts, removing and regenerating parts, discarding and regenerating parts, rejecting and renewing parts, discarding ballast or converting and regenerating in the process

1. Disposing of or recycling parts of a system that have served their purpose or have become unusable (e.g. throwing away, dissolving, evaporating): (1) The case of a spent cartridge is ejected from the bolt to prepare the next cartridge. Before the invention of cartridges, the individual components (powder, projectile and primer) had to be loaded separately. (2) To reduce costs, solid-fuel rockets were used to launch a space shuttle, which were dropped at a certain altitude and recovered for reuse.
2. Restore used parts of an object directly in the operation: (1) The worn blades of a carpet knife are simply broken off to restore the knife's full functionality. (2) A rechargeable battery is regenerated by recharging and can therefore be used again and again to supply power.

# IP #35 Parameter Changes

*Synonyms:* changing properties, change of properties, change of environment, change of properties of the object, change of physical and chemical property, transformation of physical and chemical state of an object, change of physical and chemical parameter, mastering aggregate states and their transitions, change bulk properties

1. Changing the aggregate state of an object (solid, liquid, gaseous, but also quasi-states such as elastic bodies, thixotropic substances): (1) By using a frozen suspension of abrasives in water as a grinding medium, better quality results can be achieved during grinding. As the abrasive heats up during grinding, it automatically adapts to the shape to be ground and supplies the required water itself. (2) Liquefaction of natural gas (LNG) on a ship is necessary to enable the safe and efficient transport of natural gas over long distances at sea. Liquefaction of natural gas makes it possible to transport large amounts of energy in a more compact form. This increases transport efficiency and reduces costs compared to transporting natural gas in a gaseous state.
2. Change in properties such as concentration, density, consistency, etc.: Using fuel paste instead of liquid alcohol in a fondue burner reduces the risk of accidents and burns. The gel-like consistency prevents the otherwise liquid alcohol from leaking and spilling.
3. Changing the degree of flexibility or elasticity: (1) Liquid soap can be dosed better than solid soaps and its container leaves less residue on surfaces compared to wet soap bars. (2) The adhesive in a glue stick is initially soft so that it is easy to apply before it hardens and develops its adhesive effect. (3) Liquid detergent: Liquid detergent has several advantages over traditional powders: no "clumping" even at low washing temperatures, easier to fill into the machine and fewer problems with storage.
4. Changing the temperature or volume: In self-cooling beer kegs, the beer reservoir is surrounded by a water-saturated material. Another chamber is a vacuum chamber containing zeolite. When a valve is opened, the water evaporates because it is adsorbed on the zeolite. This causes the water-saturated material to cool down significantly (evaporative cooling); conversely, the zeolite heats up, but this heat is released into the environment. Thanks to this invention, beer kegs no longer need to be cooled before use.
5. Changing the pressure: A pressure regulator ensures that a constant output pressure is always achieved, even if the input pressure fluctuates.
6. Changing the external medium, adjacent objects or the environment to an optimal setting: Magnetic resonance imaging machines can use superconductors to generate strong, homogeneous magnetic fields. Liquid nitrogen is used to cool the superconducting electromagnetic coils. This allows current to flow with zero electrical resistance to generate stronger magnetic fields than conventional systems using permanent magnets. The higher the field strength, the better the image quality and therefore the quality of the medical diagnosis.
7. Change other properties or parameters: Changing the bond strength parameter to obtain a reversible adhesive. Instead of permanent bonds, reversible adhesive uses weaker interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions or locking mechanisms. These weaker forces allow the adhesive to stick, but can be broken by external stimuli such as heat, water or pressure, allowing the bonded surfaces to separate.

# IP #36 Phase Transitions

*Synonyms:* paradigm shift, liquidity, transformable states, use of phase changes, using phase transitions, utilization of effects that occur during a phase transition

1. Utilizing the effects that occur during phase transitions (e.g. volume changes, loss or absorption of heat, etc.): (1) Gel-based heat packs use the latent heat of fusion. A bag is filled with the supercooled melt of a salt and a metal plate is used to trigger the phase change process (crystallization). Heat is generated during this process. This type of heat pack can be recharged by immersing it in hot water until the contents become liquid again and then allowing it to cool to room temperature. (2) Heat pumps use the evaporation and condensation heat of a closed thermodynamic cycle to heat or cool buildings in an energy-efficient manner.
----------

# IP #37 Thermal Expansion

*Synonyms:* relative change, applying thermal expansion, using thermal expansion and compression, expansion of events or processes

1. Use of thermal expansion or contraction of material: (1) In electrical engineering, shrink tubing is used for electrical insulation and to protect the area around conductors, sleeves and terminals. The plastic tubing shrinks radially when heated and encloses the protected components. (2) A liquid thermometer measures temperature changes due to the thermal expansion of a liquid (e.g. mercury, alcohol).
2. Using multiple materials with different thermal expansion coefficients: (1) Combination of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion coefficients to obtain alloys with zero (or specially tailored) expansion properties, e.g. Ceran® glass-ceramic cooktops with almost zero thermal expansion. (2) A simple leaf spring thermostat uses two metals with different coefficients of expansion bonded together so that they bend in one direction when they are warmer than the nominal value and in the opposite direction when they are colder, for example to control radiators. (3) The gap in the bearing of a shaft at different temperatures is compensated by two conical rings that have different thermal expansion coefficients.

# IP #38 Strong Oxidants

*Synonyms:* application of strong oxidizing agents, accelerated oxidation, strengthen oxidation, use of strongly reacting oxidizing agents, application of an active medium, strong acidifiers, accelerated oxidation, boosted interactions, enriched atmosphere, high-risk environment

1. Replacing ordinary air with oxygen-enriched air: (1) Some cleaners use oxidizing agents to remove stains better than a regular detergent. (2) Hydrogen peroxide is used in bleaching products to oxidatively destroy color pigments in the hair and thus bleach the hair.
2. Replace enriched air with pure oxygen: Pure oxygen is blown through molten pig iron with a lance to produce low-carbon steel.
3. Expose air or oxygen to ionizing radiation: In the presence of air or oxygen, ionizing radiation such as gamma rays can break down plastic molecules (chain scission). This splitting, which is assisted by oxygen, creates a denser network in some plastics, which improves strength and gas barrier when used for food packaging.
4. Using ionized oxygen: Ionizers create electrically charged oxygen molecules (ions) in the air. These ions stick to dust, pollen, and even some germs, making them heavy and falling to the ground. This helps clean the air, but may not be effective on all pollutants.
5. Using ozone: Ozone, a reactive form of oxygen (molecule made up of 3 atoms instead of 2), combats odors. In empty rooms or vehicles, ozone generators release ozone to break down odor molecules and eliminate unpleasant smells.
----------

# IP #39 Inert Atmosphere

*Synonyms:* inert environment, inert medium, calm atmosphere, chemically non-reactive environment, protective environment, use of an inert medium, use of an inert medium, low-risk environment

1. Replacing the usual medium with a less reactive or inert medium: (1) During welding, the operative zone is protected by an inert gas (e.g. argon) to prevent oxidation. (2) The air inside an incandescent lamp is replaced by an inert protective gas to prevent the tungsten filament from burning out.
2. Carry out a process in a vacuum: Foods such as cold cuts or cheese are vacuum packed to extend their shelf life and preserve their taste and appearance for longer.
3. Adding a neutral substance or inert additives to an object: (1) Shaving foam helps protect the skin and allows the razor blade to glide over the skin. Water and soap are replaced by a "slower" substance. (2) Adding foam to absorb sound vibrations, e.g. in hi-fi speakers. (3) Increasing the volume of powdered detergent by adding inert ingredients, making it easier to measure with conventional tools.
----------

# IP #40 Composite Materials

*Synonyms:* composite substances, composite structures, use of composite materials, use of heterogeneous substances, mixtures

1. Replacing a homogeneous material with a composite material: (1) Carbon fiber reinforced plastics are used in various applications with high strength and weight requirements. They consist of two main components: carbon fibers and the surrounding plastic that holds the fibers together. Aircraft structures, such as wings, are made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), which is a compound of microscopic carbon fibers bonded to a plastic resin. Individually, neither the carbon fibers nor the plastic resin could provide the mechanical and thermal properties required for an aircraft structure. However, by precisely combining the two, the strength of the composite exceeds that of many conventional metals, including aluminum and iron. In addition, the composite is much lighter than aluminum and has much higher corrosion resistance. The lower structural weight allows the aircraft to carry more payload over longer distances while using less fuel. (2) Epoxy resin/carbon fiber composite golf club shafts are lighter, stronger and more flexible than metal. (3) Surfboards and boats made of GRP (glass fiber reinforced plastic) are lighter and easier to manufacture into different shapes than wooden structures.
2. Change from uniform materials to composite materials: Unlike most other packaging, a Tetra Pak consists of several layers: cardboard for stability, plastic (polyethylene) for sealing properties and aluminum as a barrier against air and light.
